<h1>Support OsberBot</h1>
<p>
    OsberBot is hosted on a Digital Ocean server. The server cost is $5 per month.<br />
    If you are thinking about setting up a server yourself, I would recommend Digital Ocean.<br />
    If you are a student, you can get a free $100 credit, which means that if you get a $5/month server like OsberBot's, you get 20 months of free hosting.<br />
    Plus, if you use this referal link (<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=aede5f034e07">https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=aede5f034e07</a>) to sign up, you get an extra $10 credit, and I get a $25 credit.<br />
    You'll be supporting OsberBot for free by getting a free server!<br />
    If you have a project in mind and are considering getting a server, so it with Digital Ocean, and consider using that referal link!
